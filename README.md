**Scene Text Recognition (STR)**: A task in Computer Vision that aims to **locate** and **recognize** textual content within **natural scenes** automatically. It is a foundational component for numerous applications, including navigation aids, information retrieval systemsâ€¦

I built a basic training pipeline for the Scene-Text-Recoginition task. I used the **YOLOv8** model for **text detection** and constructed a **CRNN** model to **predict the text**.

I used **Airflow** to manage the project's workflow and **MLflow** to track the model training process. The entire pipeline is describle as shown in the diagram below.
